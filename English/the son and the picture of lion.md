Once upon a time, there lived a very timied-minded father in a town.

He was always worried that his son might get hurted. The son was brave and loved hunting, but his fathter prevented his son from hunting every day.

One night, the father dreamed of his son being persued by a lion. After he woke up, he thought,  "I should not leave thing like this"

The father built a strong wooden house for his son, because he belived his son would not be in a danger if he locked his son in the house. The father brought picture of animal to his son's room so that the son would not get border.

The father even stuck a picture of lion on the wooden wall. However, the son felt stuffy about just staying home.

One day, the son vented his anger on the picitrue of the lion. "You bastard, i can not go outside because of you, why did you appear in  my father 's dream and torture me ?"

The son hit the picture with his fist. Right then, the wooden wall broken down and a thorn got stuck in his hand.

The son tried to take it out, but it did not come out easily. Due to the thorn, the wound enlarged and the inflamation worsened.

After a few days, the young son die from the wound. The father who tried to shut his son lost his child because of his action.
